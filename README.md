# project-1: Perfect Date

Perfect Date is a one-page app that pulls aggregate weather data so you can plan and save dates when weather historically looks good.

* Search historical weather by location and month
* Search 1-5 years of historical weather data
* Find average weather data for any day of the week
* See breakdown of the day of week by year to get a better idea of weather patterns
* Save your ideal date to compare days by location


## Requirements
* The app uses the API Weatherstack [here](https://weatherstack.com/). The paid version is needed to use the historical data feature.
* A backend server to save dates. JSON Server was used in this project [here](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
